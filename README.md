# Overview

This game is a simple platformer with a special mechanic that allows you to invert the player's gravity in order to reach hard-to-access areas of the map. Players can move and jump with the arrow keys, and invert their gravity with the space bar. Coins and other items are collected upon contact, and when all items are collected, the map is complete.

This was my first venture into the Python Arcade library, which proved to be surprisingly easy to get started with.

# Future Work

There's a lot that could be done to improve the game as it currently stands. Some small items include:

* Add more levels, of course
* Add interation with coin/item boxes
* Introduce different values for different kinds of coins
* Improve transition between levels
* Add frontend (start/end screens)

The bigger, much more ambitious improvements/features would be things like

* Adding multiplayer/co-op gameplay, with maps requiring two-player cooperation to complete
* Adding more items and physics to interact with
* Add Animations

Who knows if I'll ever get around to that kind of thing, but I'm happy with what I've got for now.
