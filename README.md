# Overview

This game is a simple platformer with a special mechanic that allows you to invert the player's gravity in order to reach hard-to-access areas of the map. Players can move and jump with the arrow keys, and invert their gravity with the space bar. Coins and other items are collected upon contact, and when all items are collected, the map is complete.

This was my first venture into the Python Arcade library, which proved to be surprisingly easy to get started with.
